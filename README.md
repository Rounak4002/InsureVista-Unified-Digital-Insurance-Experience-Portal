## Description
_______________________________________________________________________________
### InsureVista is a full-stack insurance portal that provides a unified digital interface for customers and operations teams to manage insurance policies and claims through an interactive web application.
### InsureVista is designed to demonstrate how modern insurance platforms combine frontend user experience with backend business logic. The application allows users to submit insurance-related requests through a responsive interface while backend services handle data processing and workflow management.
### The project focuses on full-stack integration by connecting a modern frontend framework with backend REST APIs. It models real-world insurance use cases such as claim submission and policy interaction, emphasizing client–server communication and structured data flow.
### By separating frontend and backend responsibilities, InsureVista reflects how production-grade applications are built and scaled. The project highlights the importance of usability, clean integration, and real-time interaction in technology-driven insurance systems.
